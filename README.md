R7RS/R6RS/Generic Scheme portability platform

`yuni` is a portability layer for Scheme applications that would allow to run single program/library on various Scheme implementations (with some limitations). It's under development; still USELESS for most people.

## Libraries

 * `(yuni scheme)` - Subset of R7RS base library, also available on R6RS.
 * `(yuni core)` - Basic structure and typing
 * `(yuni ffi *)` - Static binding FFI (under construction)

## Language Features and Limitations

In short, yuni provides subset of R6RS library loader and subset of R7RS base libraries. On the other hand, Yuni does not try to fill implementation limitations.

See also: [Basic library sample](https://github.com/okuoku/yuni/tree/master/samples/hellolib)

### Features

- Common: Minimalistic common FFI implementation (TBD)
- For R6RS: R7RS base libraries including SRFI-46 `syntax-rules` 
- For R7RS: R6RS-lite library loader that can convert R6RS `library` form into `load` or `define-library` form (if supported)
- For Generic Scheme with `define-macro`: R7RS base libraries and non-hygienic `syntax-rules` and `library` implementation

### Limitations

Yuni is NOT designed for writing any benchmarks. Library wrapper can kill some form of optimizations which can be critical for performance.

- FFI implementation is incomplete
- No `rename` on `library` form, especially Generic Scheme does not support renaming syntax such as `let` or `define`
- Some Scheme might not have R6RS/R7RS features; such as full numeric-tower, tail-calls, `eval`, etc

## Getting Started

(Not ready yet.)
